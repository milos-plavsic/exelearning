# AGENTS.md — eXeLearning Agent Instructions

Canonical instruction file for all AI coding agents working on this repository.

## 1. Project Identity

eXeLearning is an open-source (AGPL-3.0) educational content authoring tool. Educators create interactive learning materials and export them as SCORM 1.2/2004, HTML5, EPUB3, or IMS Content Packages. The new backend runs on **Bun + Elysia + Kysely** with **Yjs** for real-time collaboration. The frontend is **vanilla JavaScript**. Desktop builds use **Electron**.

**Current state:** Early development. Prioritize clean, well-organized code.

### Definition of Done (non-negotiable)

Before any change is submitted (PR, commit push, or handoff), **all** of the following must hold:

1. **`make fix` passes** — lint and formatting are clean.
2. **Unit tests pass** — `make test-unit` is green (backend `bun test` + frontend `vitest`).
3. **Integration tests pass** — `make test-integration` is green.
4. **E2E tests pass** — `make test-e2e` is green (Playwright). Run `make test-e2e-static` too if the change affects the static build, embedding, or export flow.
5. **Patch coverage ≥ 90%** — every new or modified line must be covered by a test. Check with `make test-coverage` and inspect the diff, not just the global percentage. If a line is genuinely untestable, justify it in the PR description.
6. **New code ships with tests in the same PR.** A new `.ts` file under `src/` needs a colocated `*.spec.ts`; a new `.js` file under `public/app/` needs a colocated `*.test.js`. User-visible flows need an E2E spec under `test/e2e/playwright/specs/`.
7. **No skipped or disabled tests** without an issue link and explanation.

These apply to every skill below. If you cannot meet them, stop and ask the user — do not submit partial work.

### Philosophy

- **No workarounds.** Always build full, long-term-sustainable implementations for >1000 users. Never create compatibility shims or half-baked solutions.
- **Do not remove existing features** or UI options unless explicitly asked. Stub/annotate unfinished work instead of deleting it.
- **Single source of truth.** When two code paths need the same data, extract a shared function. Duplicated logic is a bug waiting to happen. _Example: PR #1564._
- **Extract testable pure functions.** When fixing a bug in inline arithmetic or logic, extract it into a named function with edge-case handling. _Example: PR #1546._
- **Respect platform differences.** File operations must work on Windows (EBUSY file locks), macOS, and Linux. Kill processes before deleting their files. Use `path.join()` always.

## 2. Identify Your Work Type

| Files you are touching | Work type | Test runner | Lint command |
|------------------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| `src/**/*.ts` | Backend | `bun test` | `make fix` |
| `public/app/**/*.js` | Frontend | `vitest` | `make fix` |
| `public/files/perm/idevices/**` | iDevice | `vitest` | `make fix` |
| `src/shared/export/**` | Exporter | `bun test` | `make fix` |
| `src/db/migrations/**` | Database | `bun test` | `make fix` |
| `src/routes/api/v1/**` | API v1 | `bun test` | `make fix` |
| `src/websocket/**`, `src/yjs/**` | WebSocket/Yjs | `bun test` | `make fix` |
| `public/app/yjs/**` | Yjs client | `vitest` | `make fix` |
| `test/e2e/playwright/**` | E2E test | `playwright` | `make fix` |
| `translations/**` | i18n | N/A | `make fix` |
| `assets/styles/**` | Styles | N/A | `make css` |

**Critical:** Frontend tests (`public/`) use **Vitest**. Backend tests (`src/`) use **Bun test**. Never swap them. Frontend tests fail with "window is not defined" under Bun.

## 3. Setup

```bash
make deps                       # Install dependencies (preferred over bun install)
cp .env.dist .env               # Create env file (auto-created by make check-env)
make up-local                   # Local dev server (web only)
make up-local APP_ENV=prod      # Local dev server (prod mode)
make run-app                    # Electron desktop app
make bundle                     # Build all assets (TS + CSS + JS)
make up                         # Docker dev environment
```

## 5. Testing Rules

### 5.1 Test Placement (colocated)

| Location | Pattern | Runner |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `src/**/*.spec.ts` | Backend unit tests | `bun test` |
| `public/app/**/*.test.js` | Frontend unit tests | `vitest` |
| `public/libs/**/*.test.js` | Frontend lib tests | `vitest` |
| `public/files/perm/idevices/**/*.test.js` | iDevice tests | `vitest` |
| `test/e2e/playwright/specs/*.spec.ts` | E2E tests | `playwright` |

### 5.2 Running Individual Tests

```bash
# Backend (single file)
bun test src/services/my-service.spec.ts

# Frontend (single file)
npx vitest run public/app/workarea/project/projectManager.test.js

# Frontend (specific test name)
npx vitest run public/app/path/file.test.js -t "test name"

# E2E (single file)
bun x playwright test --project=chromium test/e2e/playwright/specs/my-test.spec.ts
```

### 5.3 Coverage & Submission Gates

**Patch coverage ≥ 90% is required on every PR**, measured against the lines you added or modified — not the global project average. A PR that only raises global coverage but leaves new lines uncovered does not pass.

- **Backend (`src/`):** global target **90%**, patch coverage **≥ 90%** (hard gate).
- **Frontend (`public/app/`):** global target **80%**, patch coverage **≥ 90%** on changed lines.
- Every new `.ts` file under `src/` must ship with a colocated `*.spec.ts` in the same PR.
- Every new `.js` file under `public/app/` must ship with a colocated `*.test.js` in the same PR.
- User-visible behavior changes (workarea, preview, export, embedding, collaboration) must include or update a Playwright spec under `test/e2e/playwright/specs/`.
- Before submitting: run `make fix && make test-unit && make test-integration && make test-e2e` and inspect `make test-coverage` for the diff. All four must be green. E2E may be slow — budget time for it rather than skipping.
- Do not mark tests as `.skip` / `.todo` to land a PR. If a test cannot run in CI, open an issue and link it in the PR description.

### 5.4 Mocking — Prefer Dependency Injection

Avoid `mock.module()` in Bun tests — it can cause test pollution. The project uses a DI pattern instead:

```typescript
// Source file: export configure/resetDependencies
export function configure(newDeps: Partial<Deps>): void { deps = { ...defaultDeps, ...newDeps }; }
export function resetDependencies(): void { deps = defaultDeps; }

// Spec file: inject mocks via DI
beforeEach(() => configure({ queries: { findById: mockFindById } }));
afterEach(() => resetDependencies());
```

See [backend-service](.agents/skills/backend-service/SKILL.md) and [backend-route](.agents/skills/backend-route/SKILL.md) skills for full details.

## 6. Lint & Fix

**Always run `make fix` after any code changes.** This runs Biome for both TypeScript and JavaScript.

Config: `biome.json` — 120 char line width, 4-space indent, single quotes, trailing commas, semicolons always.

Note: Biome formatter is disabled for `public/app/**` (legacy code). Linting still applies.

## 7. Architecture Rules

### 7.1 Client is Source of Truth

The Yjs Y.Doc in the browser is the canonical document state.

```
CLIENT (Browser)                        SERVER (Bun/Elysia)
─────────────────                       ────────────────────
YjsDocumentManager (Y.Doc)              SessionManager: lightweight metadata
├── navigation (Y.Array)                WebSocket: stateless relay
├── metadata (Y.Map)                    Database: projects + yjs snapshots
├── assets (Y.Map)                      Filesystem: FILES_DIR/assets/{uuid}/
└── themeFiles (Y.Map)
```

- ELP extraction and export generation happen **client-side** by default
- Server stores assets permanently, persists Yjs snapshots, relays WebSocket
- Server-side exports are used by **CLI commands** and the **external API**
- REST API v1 (`/api/v1/*`) is designed for **external integrations** — internal frontend uses Yjs + WebSocket instead

### 7.2 Session Architecture

Every opened project gets a UUID session ID. Server maintains lightweight in-memory `Map<sessionId, ProjectSession>`.

Client-side storage:

| Storage | Pattern | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| IndexedDB | `exelearning-project-{uuid}` | Yjs Y.Doc persistence |
| IndexedDB | `exelearning` | User preferences |
| IndexedDB | `exelearning-resources-v1` | Theme/library cache |
| Cache API | `exe-assets-{uuid}` | Blob storage for images/files |

### 7.3 File Storage (Server)

`FILES_DIR` resolution: `ELYSIA_FILES_DIR` (tests) → `FILES_DIR` (.env) → `./data/` (fallback).

```
FILES_DIR/
├── assets/{projectUuid}/           # Permanent project assets
├── tmp/{year}/{month}/{day}/{id}/  # Temporary files
├── dist/{year}/{month}/{day}/{id}/ # Ready-to-download exports
├── chunks/                         # Upload chunks
├── themes/site/                    # Custom themes
└── exelearning.db                  # SQLite DB (if pdo_sqlite)
```

Key rules:
- Directories created **lazily** (on-demand), never eagerly
- Assets use project **UUID**, not numeric ID
- Always use `isPathSafe()` for user-supplied paths
- Use `path.join()` for cross-platform paths

### 7.4 Frontend Patterns

- **i18n:** `_()` for GUI strings, `c_()` for content strings, `| trans` in Nunjucks templates. Avoid hardcoded English. See [i18n skill](.agents/skills/i18n/SKILL.md).
  - **Never modify any file under `translations/`.** Wrap user-facing strings in `_()` / `c_()` / `| trans` in source code and stop there. Do **not** run `make translations`, do not add keys, do not write or edit any `<target>` value. Translation key extraction and all changes to XLF files are managed by a dedicated separate process — they must never appear in a code PR. PRs that touch `translations/**` will be rejected.
- **Styles:** Prefer SCSS classes in `assets/styles/` over inline styles. See [doc/development/styles.md](doc/development/styles.md).
- **No framework:** Vanilla JavaScript in `public/app/`.

### 7.5 Backend Patterns

- **Routes:** Elysia plugins with `{ prefix: '/api/...' }`, registered in `src/index.ts` via `.use()`
- **Queries:** Kysely functions always take `db` parameter (dependency injection)
- **Migrations:** Sequential numbering in `src/db/migrations/`, must work across SQLite/PostgreSQL/MariaDB
- **ZIP:** JSZip for extraction, Archiver for creation. Check `zipEntry.dir` before reading.

### 7.6 Preview System

Service Worker (`public/preview-sw.js`) intercepts `/viewer/*` requests. `Html5Exporter.generateForPreview()` generates files in memory, sends to SW via `postMessage`, iframe loads from SW cache.

### 7.7 ELP File Format

ZIP archives containing `content.xml` (modern) or `contentv3.xml` (legacy). Legacy .elp files from pre-v3.0 must be supported — handled client-side by `ElpxImporter.importLegacyFormat()`.

### 7.8 File Import Flow

Two paths exist. The **primary path is entirely browser-side**; the server never parses ELP files in the normal flow.

1. **Primary (browser, direct import):** User selects `.elp`/`.elpx` → browser imports in memory via Yjs (`importElpDirectly` → `importFromElpxViaYjs`) → UI refreshes from Y.Doc → saved to server on explicit save/autosave.
2. **Fallback (chunked upload):** Browser uploads in 15 MB chunks to `POST /api/project/upload-chunk` → server concatenates into temp file (no parsing) → browser reloads workarea with `?import=...` and imports client-side → browser calls `DELETE /api/project/cleanup-import` to remove temp file.

Key rule: the server is a temp store in the fallback path. The browser is always responsible for importing into Yjs.

### 7.9 Export Flow

The UI **tries browser-side first**, falling back to server-side.

1. **Primary (browser):** UI triggers export → `SharedExporters` generates ZIP in memory → browser downloads (web) or Electron saves to disk.
2. **Fallback (server):** Browser POSTs to `/api/export/:sessionId/:exportType/download` → server builds Y.Doc from DB/structure, runs exporters, writes ZIP to `dist/` → streams back for download. Used by CLI commands and the external API.

### 7.10 Embedding

Static editor embeds in LMS plugins (WordPress, Moodle, Drupal, Omeka-S) via iframe + postMessage. Key files: `RuntimeConfig.js`, `Capabilities.js`, `EmbeddingBridge.js`, `app.js`, `previewPanel.js`, `main.scss`. See `doc/development/embedding.md`.

### 7.11 Architecture Decision Records (ADR) & change documents

Significant technical work is documented before or alongside the code. Full policy: [ADR guide](doc/architecture/adr/README.md), [change guide](doc/architecture/changes/README.md).

**Identifiers are based on the GitHub tracking number — there is NO global counter.** Never compute `max(existing) + 1`; that rule is retired (see [ADR-2232-01](doc/architecture/adr/ADR-2232-01-use-tracking-issue-based-architecture-identifiers.md)). The tracking number is the change's **issue** if it has one, otherwise its **pull request** — GitHub draws both from one repository-wide sequence, so they never collide. **Never open an issue just to obtain an identifier.**

- **ADR filename**: `ADR-<number>-<NN>-<decision-slug>.md`, e.g. `ADR-1858-02-use-asset-uri-references.md`. `<NN>` is a two-digit sequence scoped **only to that tracking number**, starting at `01`; it is present even for a single ADR. The slug names the decision, not the topic. Frontmatter `id` and `tracking_issue` must match the filename (`tracking_issue` keeps its name because GitHub models a PR as an issue).
- **Change documents**: one directory per change, `doc/architecture/changes/<number>-<change-slug>/`, holding any of `proposal.md`, `spec.md`, `design.md`, `research.md`, `tasks.md`. **Create only the files with real content** — no empty placeholders — and don't duplicate content across them.
- **Create or update an ADR** when a change introduces or modifies a **durable architecture decision**: architecture, storage model, file formats (ELP/ELPX), import/export behavior, the collaboration model, security/sandboxing, accessibility strategy, public APIs (REST v1, embedding bridge), or AI-generation workflows. Don't create one ADR per section of a design, and don't create empty ADRs to fill sequence gaps — gaps are expected.
- **Create a change directory** for significant features, major refactors, design gates, cross-cutting changes, or proposals with multiple implementation phases. **Durable decisions inside a design must link to an ADR** (existing or newly proposed) — don't bury the decision.
- Templates: `doc/architecture/adr/template.md`, `doc/architecture/changes/template.md`.
- **There is no committed index.** `make architecture-records` prints one on demand; `make architecture-check` validates identifiers and metadata and runs in CI. Never create a `records.md` — a generated file in git conflicts on every concurrent branch, and these records are contributor-facing, so they are excluded from the published docs site.
- **Do not rewrite accepted ADRs** — supersede them with a new ADR (`supersedes` / `superseded_by`, and set the old one to `status: Superseded`). **Do not rewrite implemented designs** except for typo/link fixes.
- Status values: ADRs use `Proposed` / `Accepted` / `Rejected` / `Superseded`; change documents use `draft` / `in-review` / `accepted` / `implemented` / `superseded` / `abandoned`. Status lives in the frontmatter **only** — never add a `## Status` section.
- `implementation_prs` / `related.prs` are traceability lists, not the identifier. The identifier is the single stable number in `tracking_issue`.
- Retired `ADR-NNNN` / `SDD-NNNN` identifiers must not appear in new content; CI fails on them. See [`doc/architecture/migration-map.md`](doc/architecture/migration-map.md).
- Document AI assistance in the frontmatter (`ai_assistance.tool` / `ai_assistance.model`; `none` if not used).
- Mention any ADRs or change documents a PR creates or updates in the PR description.

## 8. Environment Configuration

Configure via `.env` file (use `.env.dist` as template).

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `APP_PORT` | Server port | `8080` |
| `DB_PATH` | SQLite database path | `/mnt/data/exelearning.db` |
| `DB_DRIVER` | Database driver | `pdo_sqlite` |
| `FILES_DIR` | Root for assets/tmp/dist | `/mnt/data/` (prod), `./data/` (dev) |
| `APP_SECRET` | JWT secret | (required) |
| `BASE_PATH` | URL prefix for subdirectory install | (empty) |
| `APP_AUTH_METHODS` | Auth methods | `password` |

## 9. Profiling

Use built-in debug flags before adding ad-hoc logs.

**ELPX export timing:**
```js
window.eXeLearning.config.debugElpxExport = true;
// After export: window.__lastElpxExportSummary, window.__lastElpxExportTimeline
```

**Save memory profiling:**
```js
window.eXeLearning.config.debugSaveMemory = true;
// After save: window.__lastSaveMemorySummary, window.__lastSaveMemoryTimeline
```

Full details: [doc/development/profiling.md](./doc/development/profiling.md)

## 10. E2E Testing Quick Reference

**Credentials:** `user@exelearning.net` / `1234`

**Fixtures:** `test/fixtures/` and `test/fixtures/xml/`

**Helpers** (`test/e2e/playwright/helpers/workarea-helpers.ts`):
`waitForAppReady`, `openElpFile`, `saveProject`, `openPreviewPanel`, `getPreviewFrame`, `addIdevice`, `editIdevice`, `saveIdevice`, `deleteIdevice`, `expandIdeviceCategory`

**Key selectors:**
```js
// Login
'input[type="email"]', 'input[type="password"]', 'button[type="submit"]'
// Workarea
'#head-bottom-preview', '#head-top-save-button'
// Preview
'#preview-iframe' (frameLocator), 'article', 'nav a[href*="html/"]'
```

**Guidelines:**
- Prefer deterministic waits (`waitForFunction`, `waitFor`) over `waitForTimeout()` for async operations
- Each test should create its own project for isolation
- Use helpers from `workarea-helpers.ts` to avoid duplication
- Review existing specs in `test/e2e/playwright/specs/` for patterns
- See [e2e-test skill](.agents/skills/e2e-test/SKILL.md) for full details
