# Tracking Emission: SCORM and xAPI

Reference document for **how a published eXeLearning package reports learner
scores** to a host (LMS / LRS). Two channels coexist:

- **SCORM 1.2/2004** — emitted only by SCORM exports, via the bundled SCORM API
  wrapper. Pre-existing behaviour.
- **xAPI (Experience API)** — emitted by **every** export format, always on, via
  `libs/xapi/exe_xapi.js`. Added so any published package is xAPI-compatible out
  of the box, with **no export-time option**.

Both channels are fed from the **same single score source** in
`public/app/common/common.js` (the `gamification` namespace), so the score math
is never duplicated.

### Scope

- This feature adds **xAPI statement emission** to published packages.
- It does **not** replace SCORM — SCORM output is unchanged and both channels can
  run side by side.
- It does **not** implement **cmi5**. cmi5 requires additional launch (fetch
  token), session `LaunchData`, AU metadata, `moveOn` rules, cmi5-defined context
  categories and packaging semantics that are intentionally out of scope here.
  The `initialized`/`terminated` statements below are **generic xAPI lifecycle
  statements**, not cmi5 ones.
- The package only **emits** statements. The host LMS/LRS is responsible for
  **authentication, learner identity, validation, storage and gradebook
  mapping**. The emitter never invents learner PII.

## 1. How SCORM is emitted

SCORM emission lives in `public/app/common/common.js` under
`$exeDevices.iDevice.gamification.scorm`, with the ADL wrapper files added to
SCORM exports only.

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| Score logic | `gamification.scorm` in `public/app/common/common.js` |
| SCORM API wrapper (pipwerks) | `public/app/common/scorm/SCORM_API_wrapper.js` |
| SCO lifecycle (`loadPage`/`unloadPage`) | `public/app/common/scorm/SCOFunctions.js` |
| Injected for | SCORM exports only — `SCORM_LIBRARIES` + `getScormHeadScripts()` |
| Runtime gate | `$("body").hasClass("exe-scorm")` |

Flow:

1. The exporter sets `body class="exe-scorm exe-scorm12"` and injects the wrapper
   scripts in `<head>` (`Scorm12Exporter.getScormHeadScripts()`).
2. On load, `SCOFunctions.loadPage()` calls `scorm.init()` (pipwerks).
3. Each gradable iDevice calls `gamification.scorm.registerActivity(game)` and,
   on submit, `gamification.scorm.sendScoreNew(auto, game)`.
4. Per-iDevice scores are serialised into **`cmi.suspend_data`**
   (`<n>. "<title>"; Score: <s>%; Weight: <w>%`).
5. The weighted package total (`getFinalScore`) is written to
   **`cmi.core.score.raw`** and the status to **`cmi.core.lesson_status`**
   (`passed` when total ≥ 50, else `failed`).

Every `gamification.scorm.*` method early-returns when `pipwerks` is undefined,
so SCORM does nothing outside SCORM exports.

---

### 1.1 What an iDevice must pass

Both SCORM and xAPI are driven from the same per-iDevice `options`/`game` object,
so its shape is a contract, not a convention:

- `main` — the **bare element id** of the iDevice's own container. The shared
  layer resolves it as `$('#' + main)` (or as a selector when it starts with
  `.`) and derives `ideviceId`, `title` and `ideviceNumber` from the DOM. It is
  also what keeps several instances of the same iDevice on one page reporting
  as themselves.
- `scorerp` — the score, 0–10.
- `weighted`, `isScorm`, `repeatActivity` — from the iDevice's SCORM options.
- `msgs` — the message map; this is how an iDevice's Custom texts reach the
  shared layer.

`registerActivity(options)` is called once, when the activity binds;
`sendScoreNew(auto, options)` is called when the score changes — and it is
`sendScoreNew`, not `registerActivity`, that emits the xAPI statement (§2).
Passing an object of a different shape throws inside the shared layer, and since
these calls are normally guarded the score then disappears without an error.

## 2. How xAPI is emitted

xAPI emission lives in `public/app/common/xapi/exe_xapi.js`
(`$exeDevices.iDevice.xapi`), included in **every** export via `BASE_LIBRARIES`.
It does **not** depend on SCORM/pipwerks.

### 2.1 Wiring at export time

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| Emitter library | `public/app/common/xapi/exe_xapi.js` |
| Always-on inclusion | `BASE_LIBRARIES` (`src/shared/export/constants.ts`) + `FileSystemResourceProvider.fetchBaseLibraries()` |
| Identity config in `<head>` | `window.exeXapi` injected by `PageRenderer` (both multi-page and single-page heads) |
| Config source | `Html5Exporter` / `PageExporter` pass `{ odeId, packageTitle, language }` from `meta` |

The exporter injects, before the emitter script:

```html
<script>window.exeXapi={"odeId":"202604272111114JQLDV","packageTitle":"…","language":"en"}</script>
<script src="libs/xapi/exe_xapi.js"> </script>
```

The serialized config is **HTML-safe**: `PageRenderer.serializeForScript()` escapes
`<` (→ `<`) plus U+2028/U+2029 before embedding, so a package title containing
`</script>` cannot break out of the inline `<script>` (no XSS).

The config shape is a single source of truth: the TypeScript type `XapiConfig`
(`src/shared/export/interfaces.ts`) declares **exactly** the keys the emitter reads
in `exe_xapi.js#_resolveConfig`. It has two groups of keys:

- **Identity keys** — `odeId`, `baseIri`, `activityId`, `packageTitle`, `language`.
  Populated by `Html5Exporter` / `PageExporter` from `meta` on every export.
- **Delivery keys** — `parentOrigin`, `actor`, `registration`. These are **opt-in
  and NOT populated by the default export pipeline**. Origin-restricted postMessage
  delivery (`parentOrigin`), a pre-resolved learner `actor`, and an attempt
  `registration` require runtime context the static exporter does not have (the
  embedding origin / LMS-provided learner). They are supplied at runtime by the
  embedding bridge (or by xAPI launch URL params; see §2.4) rather than baked into
  the export. When absent, the emitter broadcasts to `'*'` with an anonymous actor.

### 2.2 Identifiers (IRIs)

Stable, derived from the package `odeId` and per-iDevice `odeIdeviceId`
(see [ids.md](./ids.md)):

- Package activity: `https://exelearning.net/xapi/{odeId}`
- Per iDevice: `https://exelearning.net/xapi/{odeId}/idevice/{odeIdeviceId}`

When no `odeId` is available the emitter falls back to the document URL, so
statements stay structurally valid.

### 2.3 Statements

Fed from `gamification.track('answered', game)` (called by `sendScoreNew`, before
the SCORM gate) and the running aggregate (reusing the pure `getFinalScore`):

- **Per iDevice** — verb [`answered`](http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/answered),
  object = per-iDevice IRI, `result.score = { scaled, raw, min: 0, max: 10 }`.
- **Package** — verb [`completed`](http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/completed) plus
  [`passed`](http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/passed) /
  [`failed`](http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/failed) at the same ≥ 50 threshold,
  `result.score = { scaled, raw, min: 0, max: 100 }`.
- **Lifecycle (generic xAPI, not cmi5)** —
  [`initialized`](http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/initialized) emitted once on load
  and [`terminated`](http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/terminated) once on
  `pagehide`/`unload`, both against the package Activity and only when a transport
  is available. They carry no `result`.

Each statement also includes richer metadata:

- `object.definition` with a stable `type` IRI
  (`…/activities/assessment` for the package, `…/activities/cmi.interaction` for
  an iDevice) and a localized `name` language map using the package `language`.
- `context.registration` when a registration value is available, from the launch
  URL (`registration=`) **or** the injected config (`window.exeXapi.registration`).
- `context.contextActivities.parent` linking each iDevice statement to the package
  Activity.
- `context.extensions` with eXeLearning metadata, each key present only when its
  value is available (no invented data), under stable IRIs:
  - `https://exelearning.net/xapi/extensions/package-id`
  - `https://exelearning.net/xapi/extensions/idevice-id`
  - `https://exelearning.net/xapi/extensions/idevice-type`
  - `https://exelearning.net/xapi/extensions/page-id` (when supplied by the event)
  - `https://exelearning.net/xapi/extensions/page-title` (when supplied by the event)

Statement shape follows the xAPI Data spec:
<https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Data.md>.

### 2.4 Transport (silent fall-through)

1. **`window.postMessage` to the parent** (default; for packages embedded in a
   host activity module). Message contract:

   ```js
   window.parent.postMessage({ type: 'exe-xapi-statement', statement }, targetOrigin);
   ```

   `targetOrigin` is the configured `parentOrigin` so the statement is delivered
   only to the intended host. It falls back to `'*'` **only** when no
   `parentOrigin` is configured (best-effort delivery); this is safe because the
   emitter never puts learner PII in a statement (anonymous account agent when
   none is supplied).

   Embedding platforms such as Moodle can consume these statements by adding a
   listener in the host activity module. In Moodle, a proper integration should
   validate the authenticated user/session, verify that the statement belongs to
   the current activity instance, and map accepted statements to Moodle events
   and/or gradebook updates — for example through a plugin xAPI handler. This
   host-side consumption is **not** implemented in this repository.

2. **LRS POST** when xAPI launch parameters are present in the URL
   (`endpoint`, `auth`, optional `actor`, `registration`):

   ```
   POST {endpoint}statements
   Authorization: {auth}
   X-Experience-API-Version: 1.0.3
   ```

   See <https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md>.

3. **No-op** when neither a parent window nor launch parameters exist (plain web
   / offline EPUB). All transport code is wrapped in `try/catch` so tracking can
   never break page rendering.

### 2.5 Notes

- The emitter debounces duplicate statements (same iDevice + same score) and
  assigns each statement a UUID `id` for LRS idempotency.
- The package-level statement reuses `gamification.scorm.getFinalScore()` (a pure
  function) for the weighted total — single source of truth with SCORM.
- The `initialized`/`terminated` lifecycle statements are emitted at most once and
  are plain xAPI lifecycle statements. They are **not** cmi5: this emitter does
  not implement cmi5 launch, fetch token, `LaunchData`, `moveOn` rules, AU
  metadata, cmi5 context categories or cmi5 packaging.
